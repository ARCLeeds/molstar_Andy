# Interactions Example

An example showcasing features of the `interactions` extension, including:

- Computing interactions on demand using Mol*'s built-in interaction computation code
- Triggering interaction computation separately for multiple ligands stored in a single SDF file
- Specifying interaction manually from custom data source
- Synthetic example showing all supported interaction types

To run development build locally use

```bash
  npm run dev -- -e interactions
```
